Overview
This project is a Bus Management System built using React. It allows users (admin or passengers) to manage and browse bus schedules, book tickets, and monitor bus availability. The project features a clean UI for adding buses, routes, and seats, as well as tracking bookings and managing bus schedules.

Features
Bus Management: Add, edit, and delete buses and their details (bus name, number, route, seats, etc.).
Route Management: Create and manage routes for each bus.
Ticket Booking: Allows users to search buses based on the route and book tickets.
Booking Management: Admin can track all bookings, and users can view their booking history.
Real-Time Bus Availability: Displays the number of available seats in real-time.
Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

Usage

Filter Buses by Route: Users can filter available buses based on a selected route.
Customization
Backend Integration: Connect the app to a backend server (Node.js, Firebase, etc.) for handling bus data, bookings, and route management. Modify API calls accordingly.
Payment Integration: Add payment gateways for users to make payments while booking tickets.
Seat Management: Enhance the seat selection UI to display a graphical representation of bus seats.
UI Customization: Customize the styles, components, or features to better fit specific needs.
Example
Admin Dashboard: Admins can add new buses, set up routes, and manage seat availability for each bus.
Booking Flow: Users select a route, view available buses, and book their seats.
Real-Time Availability: Available seats update in real-time as users book tickets.
Dependencies
React: Frontend framework for building the UI.
Axios or Fetch API: For making API requests to a backend or database.
React Router: For routing between different pages (dashboard, booking, etc.).
CSS or Styled Components: For styling the app components.
React Context or Redux: For managing global state (e.g., bus data, bookings).
Backend API (Optional)
If using a backend for bus data and bookings, set up the backend and API to handle requests for:

Bus Management: Create, read, update, and delete buses.
Route Management: Add or update routes for each bus.
Ticket Booking: Handle seat reservations and bookings.
User Authentication: Optional for user login and dashboard access.
Security Considerations
Form Validation: Ensure proper validation for booking forms to prevent incorrect data input.
Authentication: Implement user roles (admin and regular users) with protected routes and access control.
